# git-treesame-commit

Utility to make new commits that are
[treesame](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#_history_simplification)
with others.

### Warning 

This program performs an unconditional `git reset --hard` which may result in destruction of staged changes, work history and unrecoverable loss of worktree changes

### Description

Every commit has a _treehash_, or, a specific identifier that represents
the state of the file tree. Two commits that have the exact same file
tree and thus the exact same treehash are called _treesame_.

This tool allows you to create a new commit on your current branch that
is treesame with any arbitrary commit anywhere else. It's basically like
being able to cherry-pick the entire state of a file tree.

This tool has transformed how quickly I am able to figure out and
debug git situations and I can't understand how this isn't built in to
git already.

```
